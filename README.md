# Base64

**[Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)** is a group of similar [binary-to-text encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding) schemes that represent [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data) in an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) string format by translating it into a [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)-64 representation. The term *Base64* originates from a specific [MIME content transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding). Each base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.

The particular set of 64 characters chosen to represent the 64 place-values for the base varies between implementations. The general strategy is to choose 64 characters that are both members of a subset common to most encodings, and also [printable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_character). This combination leaves the data unlikely to be modified in transit through information systems, such as email, that were traditionally not [8-bit clean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_clean).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#cite_note-autogenerated2006-1) For example, MIME's Base64 implementation uses `A`–`Z`, `a`–`z`, and `0`–`9` for the first 62 values.

#### Example

A quote from [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes)' *Leviathan*:

> Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from other animals, which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continued and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure.

is represented as a byte sequence of 8-bit-padded [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters encoded in [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)'s Base64 scheme as follows:

> TWFuIGlzIGRpc3Rpbmd1aXNoZWQsIG5vdCBvbmx5IGJ5IGhpcyByZWFzb24sIGJ1dCBieSB0aGlzIHNpbmd1bGFyIHBhc3Npb24gZnJvbSBvdGhlciBhbmltYWxzLCB3aGljaCBpcyBhIGx1c3Qgb2YgdGhlIG1pbmQsIHRoYXQgYnkgYSBwZXJzZXZlcmFuY2Ugb2YgZGVsaWdodCBpbiB0aGUgY29udGludWVkIGFuZCBpbmRlZmF0aWdhYmxlIGdlbmVyYXRpb24gb2Yga25vd2xlZGdlLCBleGNlZWRzIHRoZSBzaG9ydCB2ZWhlbWVuY2Ugb2YgYW55IGNhcm5hbCBwbGVhc3VyZS4K

In the above quote, the encoded value of *Man* is *TWFu*. Encoded in ASCII, the characters *M*, *a*, and *n* are stored as the bytes `77`, `97`, and `110`, which are the 8-bit binary values `01001101`, `01100001`, and `01101110`. These three values are joined together into a 24-bit string, producing `010011010110000101101110`. Groups of 6 bits (6 bits have a maximum of 26 = 64 different binary values) are [converted into individual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Counting_in_binary) from left to right (in this case, there are four numbers in a 24-bit string), which are then converted into their corresponding Base64 character values.

## Base64 Library

This is a C library to encode ASCII string to base64 format and decode base64 string to ASCII.

### Functions

- **base64_encode**

  ```c
  char* base64_encode(char* plain);
  /***********************************************
  Encodes ASCCI string into base64 format string
  @param plain: ASCII string to be encoded
  @return encoded base64 format string
  ***********************************************/
  ```

- **base64_decode**

  ```c
  char* base64_decode(char* cipher);
  /***********************************************
  decodes base64 format string into ASCCI string
  @param plain encoded base64 format string
  @return ASCII string to be encoded
  ***********************************************/
  ```
